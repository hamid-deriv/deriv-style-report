const complexity = `
In software engineering, **Cyclomatic Complexity** is a metric concerning the number of moving parts in a code. These moving parts are usually pointed within some control flow (if, else, while, etc.), and the more of them we find, the greater our Cyclomatic Complexity. Naturally, we want to keep our Cyclomatic Complexity **as low as** possible, as greater complexity means that:

- Code is harder to reason about;
- There are more potential points of failure;
- Code is harder to modify, maintain, or reuse;
- Youâ€™re left with more outcomes and side effects to be aware of;
- Code is more difficult to test.
